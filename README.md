- **For:** UC Berkeley IEOR 165 Course Project 
- **Research Paper:** "Modeling wine preferences by data miningfrom physicochemical properties‚Äù by Cortez, A. Cerdeira, F. Almeida, T. Matos, and J. Reis
- **Dataset:** http://courses.ieor.berkeley.edu/ieor165/homeworks/winequality-red.csv
- **Project:** Wine can be evaluated by experts who give a subjective score, and the question the authors of this paper considered was how to build a model that relates objective features of the wine (e.g., pH values) to its rated quality.
- **Goal:** Comparison of Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, and Elastic Net
